# kx-clearchat 
My edit of an older chat clearing script with some added features and made it more compatiable with custom chat scripts.


# Installation
    - Download the zip and extract the folder
    - If needed, rename the folder from "kx-clearchat-master" to "kx-clearchat"
    - I highly recommend you put the script inside a [KXscripts] folder if you use multiple of my scripts. If not simply place it in a [standalone] folder.
 

# Server.cfg Installation

    - Make sure you have ensure [standalone] OR [KXscripts] depending which sub folder you put the script into inside your server.cfg
    EX: ensure [KXscripts]


    - Inside your server.cfg add the following code under any admin permission section.

                   ## Chat Permissions ##
          add_ace group.admin chat.clear allow # allow chat commands
    

    - After that restart your server and you're done.
    - Command: /clearchat


# This script will not receive frequent updates unless qb-core makes changes to their framework that would make it incompatible.

# This script will not be receiving any support as it is a simple drag and drop.
